<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially wanted to build CogitoSync AI, a cognitive social platform. The project evolved from a basic MVP (V1) to a mobile-first PWA (V2), and then to a full-fledged social network (V3) with features like anonymous profiles, a social feed, an AI coach, and advanced community rooms.

After a complex and fragmented V3 implementation, the project was handed over for final integration. The subsequent user requests focused on:
1.  **V3.0 Finalization:** Consolidating all V3 code, fixing bugs (especially OpenAI key issues and database serialization), and performing a full system test.
2.  **UI/UX Overhaul:** Implementing a modern design with specific color palettes (first a purple/teal gradient, then Mistik Mor), glassmorphism, animations, and a new logo.
3.  **Turkish Localization:** Translating the entire frontend UI and all backend AI-generated content into fluent, high-quality Turkish.
4.  **V3.1 Bilingual Support (Current Task):** Upgrading the application to support both Turkish and English, selectable by the user. This requires implementing an i18n framework, creating translation files, and updating both the frontend and backend to be language-aware.

**User's preferred language**: Türkçe (Turkish). The next agent MUST respond in Turkish unless the user switches the context to English. The application itself is being made bilingual, with Turkish as the default.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a fully functional, production-ready CogitoSync v3.0, completely localized in Turkish. The V3 feature set (profiles, feed, AI coach, etc.) is complete and stable. The UI has been overhauled with the Mistik Mor theme, glassmorphism, and a custom logo. All previously identified bugs and integration issues have been resolved.

The agent has just begun the V3.1 upgrade to add bilingual (Turkish/English) support. The  library and its related packages have been successfully installed. Comprehensive translation files,  and , have been created and populated with all necessary UI text.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was in the initial phase of implementing bilingual (English/Turkish) support for version 3.1.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. This is crucial for verifying that all text is correctly loaded from the i18n files and that the language-switching functionality works across all components. Manual  checks will be needed for the backend AI responses.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   None. The current work is a planned feature implementation, not a bug fix.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Bilingual (TR/EN) Support for v3.1 (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** The translation JSON files and dependencies are ready. The immediate next step is to create the i18n configuration file (e.g., ), initialize , and wrap the root component in  or  with the .
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The application will support both Turkish and English, allowing users to switch languages. This will make the app accessible to a wider audience.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both. The frontend needs to be tested for correct string replacement and language switching. The backend needs to be tested to ensure it generates AI content (from the coach, CSS analysis, etc.) in the user's selected language.
    -   **Blocked on something:** Nothing.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks (as part of the current v3.1 task):**
    -   **Refactor Frontend Components (P0):** Go through every component and page file in  and replace all hardcoded Turkish strings with the  hook and the corresponding keys from the  files.
    -   **Implement Language Switcher (P0):** Add a UI element (e.g., a dropdown or toggle) for the user to switch between Türkçe and English. This should be placed in a logical location like the settings area within the  and potentially on the . The selected language should be saved to .
    -   **Update Backend for Language Awareness (P0):** Modify the backend logic in . The user's selected language needs to be passed with API requests (e.g., in a header or JWT payload). The AI-related functions (, , etc.) must then use this language parameter to select the correct prompt (Turkish or English).
    -   **Update Database Seeding for Bilingual Rooms (P1):** Modify  and the room logic to support storing and retrieving room names in both languages.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **CogitoSync v3.0 Integration:** Successfully merged all V3 code, creating a stable, unified application.
-   **Full Turkish Localization:** Translated the entire UI and all AI-generated content into Turkish.
-   **UI/UX Overhaul:** Implemented a complete visual redesign featuring the Mistik Mor theme, glassmorphism, custom animations, and a new brand logo.
-   **Bug Fixes:** Resolved critical issues, including OpenAI API integration,  serialization errors, and WebSocket stability.
-   **Feature Completion:** Implemented all V3 features, including missing endpoints for Empathy Match, AI Forecast, Mood Journal, and CSS Reactions.
-   **Production Deployment:** Performed multiple production builds, service restarts, and comprehensive testing cycles to ensure stability.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. All issues from the initial handoff and those discovered during the session have been resolved.
